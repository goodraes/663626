	35、人生要像时钟一样，无论外面的世界多乱，它都会静静地在转动。
一只麻雀飞到佛祖的头上屙屎，弟子问佛祖，麻雀有无佛性？佛祖回答，麻雀肯定有佛性，万物皆有佛性。还有另一说：在极乐世界里，阿弥陀佛采用鸟的歌声来说“法”，用风吹树叶来演奏百千种音乐。,佛法强调“本体”是平等的法身、佛性也是平等的。阿弥陀佛最后变成鸟天天唱不同的歌曲来显身说“法”，也许这些笼子里的麻雀都是阿弥陀佛的化身。至于麻雀被困在笼子里，到底何种机缘，此乃禅宗之直观悟性之事，我等凡夫俗子，不得而知，也不敢过问。　　后来我们又到各式庙宇里参观一下，瞻仰了菩萨的慈容，领略了罗汉的凶神，在此过程中我有点心不在焉，怪怪的感觉，笼子里的麻雀在我的脑子里总是挥之不去，有点怨恨佛祖不该拿麻雀来说“法”，想到此感觉头有点晕，后来有点严重，心里觉得自己是不是中了邪？越想还越有点害怕，我赶紧催促我的同学回去。　　在回来的路上，我又看见了那些带有佛性的麻雀，终于明白了他们的佛性是如何而来，来自何方。在此时，我又想起了冯骥才《麻雀的心》的一段话，我也觉得这段话来总结本文最合适不过了。“这样的发现使我忍不住动容，知悉如果我们有更体贴的心，就能更进人万物的内在，如果我们的心有如镜子明澈，我们就能照见众生平等、皆有佛性、遍及法界的真实了。”　　在公交车上时，我记起以前看过的关于老宅闹鬼的文章，闹鬼的原因在于年久的木料发出一种气味，该种气味能使人头晕，想到此，我的心也释然了，我的头也不晕了。

35, life is like a clock, no matter how messy, the outside world it will be quietly in the rotation.
E excrement a sparrow flew to the Buddha's head, the disciple asked the Buddha, sparrows have buddha-nature?
The Buddha answered, sparrows certainly has a Buddha nature, all things have Buddha nature.
There is another story: in heaven, amitabha "law" by the singing of birds, to play with the wind leaves one hundred thousand kinds of music.
, Buddhism emphasizes the "ontology" is equal dharmakaya, Buddha nature is created equal.
Amitabha finally become a bird sing different songs every day to show body said "law", perhaps the sparrow cages are the incarnation of amitabha.
As for the sparrow was trapped in a cage, exactly what kind of chance, this is the intuitive understanding of the zen, I wait for the everyman, unknown, also dare not to ask.
Later we again to the various temples around, saw the bodhisattva CiRong, appreciate the ocean's a demon, and I'm a little distracted in the process, very strange feeling, a sparrow cages are always lingering in my mind, the Buddha shouldn't take a little resentment sparrow "law", think that this feeling a bit dizzy, then a bit serious, whether in the evil heart feel?
Want to also is a little scared, I urged my classmates back quickly.
On the way back, I saw those sparrows with Buddha nature, finally understand how their buddha-nature, from where.
At this point, I again remind of the feng jincai "sparrow heart" of a paragraph, I also think this passage to summarized in this paper, the most appropriate.
"These findings make I can't help but deeply aware if we have more caring heart, can more in the inner of all things, if our heart is like a mirror clear, we can close all living things equality, all has Buddha nature, throughout the dharmadhatu real."
On the bus, I remember what ever seen on my old house is haunted, haunted the reason is that the timber emits a smell of years, this kind of smell can make people dizzy, think of this, my heart also release however, I also don't fall in a faint.
